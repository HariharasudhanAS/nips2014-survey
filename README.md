# Survey of hyperparameter optimization in NIPS2014

In this survey we checked all papers from NIPS2014 to investigate what methods were used by the authors to select the best parameters. This survey was performed for our hyperparameter optimization software [Optunity](http://www.optunity.net).
If you find any mistakes please let us know or submit a pull request.

## Summary
86 papers used any kind of hyperparameter search:

* 82 used **grid search**
* 2 used **random search**
* 1 used **Spearmint**
* 1 proposed a new hyperparameter optimization method
